## 📚 Course Management API

📚 A robust RESTful API for a course management system built with Node.js and Express. Features comprehensive CRUD operations with proper validation and clean architecture. Ideal for educational platforms or learning management systems.

## 🔑 Key Features  
- **Full CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for courses  
- **Express-validator middleware** for robust input validation  
- **Clean architecture** with MVC pattern  
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes  
- In-memory data persistence (easily extendable to databases)  
- Error handling middleware  
- Organized route management  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- Express-validator  
- REST API principles

## 🌐 API Endpoints  

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                  |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/courses         | Retrieve all courses         |
| GET    | /api/courses/:id     | Get single course            |
| POST   | /api/courses         | Create new course            |
| PUT    | /api/courses/:id     | Update existing course       |
| DELETE | /api/courses/:id     | Remove course                |

## ✅ Best Practices  
- Strict input validation using express-validator  
- Consistent error handling middleware  
- Modular code structure for scalability  
- Separation of concerns with MVC architecture  
- Clear documentation for endpoints  
- Semantic versioning support
